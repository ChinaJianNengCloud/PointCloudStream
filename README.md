# PCDStreamerUI

## Overview

**PCDStreamerUI** is a desktop application built using PyQt5 and VTK that provides an interactive GUI for visualizing and managing 3D point cloud data (PCD). It integrates with robotic systems, camera calibration tools, and data collection workflows, enabling users to perform tasks such as real-time point cloud rendering, robot-hand-eye calibration, and interactive data management.

## Key Features

- **VTK Integration:** Real-time rendering of 3D point clouds.
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly PyQt5 interface with customizable tabs and widgets.
- **Robot Integration:** Control and monitor robotic systems.
- **Camera Calibration:** Tools for board calibration with adjustable parameters.
- **Data Collection:** Interface for collecting, managing, and saving point cloud and RGBD data.
- **Agent Communication:** Connects to external servers for chatbot-based commands and logging.
- **Customizable Views:** Switch between camera view, bird's eye view, and more.
- **Data Viewer Tool:** Located in `app.utils.data_management.data_viewer.py`, this standalone viewer allows inspecting point cloud datasets. Use the following key bindings:
   - **A:** View previous scene
   - **D:** View next scene
   - **X:** Label invalid scene
   - **Q:** Save and Exit

## Environment Setup

### Create and Configure the Environment

1. Create a Conda environment with Python 3.11:
    ```bash
    yes | conda create -n o3d311 python=3.11
    conda activate o3d311
    ```

2. Install CUDA toolkit and dependencies for PyTorch:
    ```bash
    conda install cuda-toolkit=11.8 cuda-nvcc=11.8 cudnn=8.9 pytorch=2.2 torchvision=0.17.2 torchaudio=2.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    ```

3. Alternatively, for a different CUDA version:
    ```bash
    cuda_version=12.1
    conda install cuda-toolkit=$cuda_version cuda-nvcc=$cuda_version cuda-compiler=$cuda_version cudnn=8.9 pytorch=2.2.2 torchvision=0.17.2 torchaudio=2.2.2 pytorch-cuda=$cuda_version -c pytorch -c nvidia
    ```

### Install Additional Packages

- Install other required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy==1.26
    pip install open3d plyfile ipykernel pyqt5 opencv-python-headless zeroconf tqdm matplotlib lebai-sdk
    pip install vtk
    ```
